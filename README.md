   <td>  In addition to your assigned reading from the “Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture”, you have been provided several links to online articles for review. One important topic is a discussion on the definition of enterprise architecture. As you can conclude from your readings, it isn’t easy to come up with a definition that encompasses all that EA enables. There are often several definitions provided, all right in their own way.</td>

For our topic this week, please provide:

<ol>

 <li>Your own definition of EA, and</li>

 <li>Why you believe it is important to align it with the organization’s core goals and strategic direction</li>

</ol>

Also, please refer to your “Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture” , Figure 3, page 9 and provide a response to:

<ol start="3">

 <li>Why is it important to maintain “Control and Oversight” in the Enterprise Architecture Process?</li>

</ol>

As this is our first week together, it is always nice to hear from you regarding your own perspectives on EA. So feel free to provide any personal examples or experience you have throughout this course!

Take the time to watch this YouTube video covering enterprise architecture from the Department of Defense Acquisition program perspective. <em>The video is approximately 80 minutes in length, so, you may want to break up the viewing of it over more than one session.</em> (We will be reviewing/discussing it in <strong>Week 2</strong> as well…..)  The goal is to give you a clearer perspective of what is meant by ‘enterprise architecture’.The video, in the simplest form, describes architecture as “<em>the structure of components and their relationships, in a logical, purposeful manner</em>”.

The “FEAC Certified Enterprise Architect (CEA) Study Guide” (Rao, Reedy, and Bellman; McGraw Hill) describes architecture as “<em>A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at the component level, to guide its implementation (ISO/IEC, 2007); the structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.</em>”

The interrelationships of components are addressed as “complexity items”. Complexity items are described as “effects between different relationships, of which their characteristics fall into one or more main themes”. In the Department of Defense (DoD) realm, these themes fall into the following categories (albeit, this list is not all-inclusive):

– Operational

– Information (Data)

– Services

– Technology

In a separate Response:

2.a.  Identify a complexity item (think of a complexity item as a business process) between different relationships (think of different relationships as two (or more) distinctive sections) within your organization, workplace, or perhaps a business or firm that you deal with on a regular basis—succinctly describe this business process and its interrelated impact on the respective organizational sections.

2.b.  Then, identify the respective theme (or themes) in which this business process falls in to—be specific. Answer the questions, <em>Why is this business process important? </em>and, <em>How do the selected theme(s) affect this business process?</em>

<em>I will then provide you with feedback, questions, or recommended adjustments.</em>

So, for this week’s discussions, you should have <strong>two separate posts</strong>.
